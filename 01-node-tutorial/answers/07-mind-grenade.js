// (3d). 07-mind-grenade.js may not export anything, but it should contain a function that logs something to the console. You should then call that function within the code of 07-mind-grenade.js. This is to demonstrate that when a module is loaded with a require statement, anything in the mainline code of the loaded module runs.

// NOTE: The only program you should need to actually invoke to test that everything is working is 03-modules.js, because it loads all the others (files 4-7).

const value1 = 8;
const value2 = 15;

const addValues = () => {
    console.log(`the sum is : ${value1 + value2}`);
