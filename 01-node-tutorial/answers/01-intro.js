// 01-intro.js: This program should use the console.log function to write something to the screen. While you are in the “answers” directory, run the command, node 01-intro.js, to verify that the program runs. You can also put additional JavaScript logic in your program.

console.log('Writing something to the screen');

// Additional logic
const talkative = true;

if (talkative === true) {
    console.log('I am feeling chatty');
} else {
    console.log('Shhhhh!');
}
