3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    - How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    Answer:  Use dotenv and call its config method to load the variables from the .env file into process.env. This makes the variables accessible throughout the application.

    - How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
    Answer: To protect the contents of the .env file so it is not stored in your GitHub repository, add .env to the .gitignore file at the root of your project.
